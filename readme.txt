# Monte-Carlo-Poker Simulations
Calculates the probability of winning a texas holdem poker round given starting hand. Can factor for number of players and the values of the cards, which breaks ties given shared winning hand. Admittedly, it does not scale well with number of players because of the number of simulations and hands dealt needed to accommodate poker's seemingly infinite number of possibilities is, well, a lot.

Current scripts accurately creates hands and simulates rounds. Regarding the winning percentage, the values are close to verified ones for two players, and I haven't found a source for winning percentages for games with more than 2 players.
